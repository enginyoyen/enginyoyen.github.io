				<p class="leading-relaxed">
					I'm Engin Yöyen — a software engineer, father, avid reader, aspiring home chef, and
					motorcyclist. Currently based in Berlin, where most of my time revolves around

					I co-founded <a

						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">TrustPath.io</a
					>—we're in the cybersecurity business, stopping fraud before it even thinks about
					happening. We like to think of it as digital crime-fighting, minus the capes. Our platform
					helps organizations build digital trust and prevent fraud through advanced security
					measures.

					<span>What I'm Writing</span>
				</h2>
				<p class="leading-relaxed">
					I write books and technical articles about software engineering, cybersecurity, and the
					lessons I've learned along the way. Sometimes I write just to see if anyone's reading,
					sometimes to share ideas that might help someone down the road.

					<span>Background</span>
				</h2>
				<p class="leading-relaxed">
					I've dabbled in everything from the Internet of Things to Telecommunications, Smart
					Classrooms, CMS platforms, and more. Yes—I do build software. I've even done it at places
					you might've heard of… like <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>eBay</strong>. (Name
					drop: achieved.)
				</p>
				<p class="leading-relaxed">
					My educational background is a mix of everything but the kitchen sink: <strong
						>Computer Science + Psychology</strong
					> (yes, really), <strong>Business Administration</strong>, and a <strong
						>Master's in Embedded Software Engineering</strong
					>. This eclectic combination helps me understand both the technical and human sides of
					technology.

					<span>What Drives Me</span>
				</h2>
				<p class="leading-relaxed">
					I love tinkering with tech, writing things (sometimes just to see if anyone's reading),
					experimenting with new ideas, and learning weird, wonderful stuff no one asked for—but
					someone, someday, might need.

					<span>Life Outside Code</span>
				</h2>
				<p class="leading-relaxed">
					When I'm not writing code or building companies, you'll find me exploring Berlin on two
					wheels, experimenting in the kitchen (with mixed results), or spending time with my
					family. Life's about balance—or at least trying to find it.
